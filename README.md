# acorn
A generic test automation framework

to use this you would change the domain in acorn project to specify your domain.

There are many placeholder files here so git did not strip out directories.

I made this so I can reuse myself when I need to create a new automation test framework.

Log4J2 should be working
In framework there is a properties file to load for global vars.

I will be refactoring as I can to make this better.  I'm sure there is a lot that can be done better than this.
